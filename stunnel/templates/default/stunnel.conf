; Sample stunnel configuration file by Michal Trojnara 2002-2009
; Some options used here may not be adequate for your particular configuration
; Please make sure you understand them (especially the effect of the chroot jail)

; Certificate/key is needed in server mode and optional in client mode
;cert = /etc/ssl/certs/stunnel.pem
;key = /etc/ssl/certs/stunnel.pem

; Protocol version (all, SSLv2, SSLv3, TLSv1)
sslVersion = SSLv3

; Some security enhancements for UNIX systems - comment them out on Win32
chroot = <%= @chroot %>
setuid = <%= @uid %>
setgid = <%= @gid %>
; PID is created inside the chroot jail
pid = /stunnel4.pid

; Some performance tunings
socket = l:TCP_NODELAY=1
socket = r:TCP_NODELAY=1
;compression = zlib

; Workaround for Eudora bug
;options = DONT_INSERT_EMPTY_FRAGMENTS

; Authentication stuff
;verify = 2
; Don't forget to c_rehash CApath
; CApath is located inside chroot jail
;CApath = /certs
; It's often easier to use CAfile
;CAfile = /etc/stunnel/certs.pem
; Don't forget to c_rehash CRLpath
; CRLpath is located inside chroot jail
;CRLpath = /crls
; Alternatively you can use CRLfile
;CRLfile = /etc/stunnel/crls.pem

; Some debugging stuff useful for troubleshooting
;debug = 7
;output = /var/log/stunnel4/stunnel.log

; Service-level configuration

client = yes
[redis]
accept = <%= @accept %>
connect = <%= @connect %>
retry = yes
