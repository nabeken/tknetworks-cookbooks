# The command used to execute all actions.  By default, apt-get is used.
# Change this to /usr/bin/aptitude to use aptitude instead, which will
# resolve changed Recommends (and Suggests as well, if aptitude is so
# configured). You can also set other utilities (especially useful in the
# config.d directory) so set some completely different tool.
# OBSERVE that this tool is indended for apt-get and tools like aptitude do not
# have full support for noninteractive upgrades. You may have to tune options
# to not create infinit logfiles for example.
